AngularJS
===========
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a JavaScript Framework provided by Google. It focuses on minimizing the HTML's limitation of serving only static contents. AngularJS is a great solution for building single page web-applications, which reduces the data transmission cost over network. It would not be wrong in saying that AngularJS extends HTML and provides it additional features for dynamic web programming.

AngularJS was built by keeping the needs of a CRUD web-application in mind, and hence these applications are the best use-case for AngularJS. Applications like Games, GUI editors require intensive and tricky DOM Manipulation and hence represent a use case which does not require AngularJS.

AngularJS provides following advantages
 * Removes boilerplate code of registering callback functions
 * Removes the need of extra code for manipulating HTML DOM programmatically
 * It automatically marshals the data to and from the UI
 * Less Code to be written

Some important concepts of AngularJS
####Template 	
Template is a piece of HTML code that contains Angular specific elements and attributes. Angular combines the template with data from the model and controller to render the dynamic view.

####Directives 	
Directives extend HTML with custom attributes and elements. Angular provides some directives out of the box e.g. ng-app, ng-bind etc. We can create custom directives which provide additional functionality to HTML.

####Model 	
Model is the data in angular application. Data can be bounded in expressions for display or inputs for reading. Data model is updated automatically to-and-from by Angular.

####Scope 	
Scope is th context in which an app or a controller works. RootScope is the parent scope of all the scopes. A scope can be used to share data or functions.

####Expressions 	 
Expressions are a way to access data or functions available in scope.

####Compiler 	
Angular Compiler parses the templates and instantiates directives and expressions in an angular app.

####Filter 	
Selects specified elements from a given array, and filters out the rest.

####Controller 	
Angular Controller controls the flow of data to, from and within an angular application.
