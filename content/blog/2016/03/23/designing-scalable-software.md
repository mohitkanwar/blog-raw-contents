Designing Scalable Software
===========================
Scalability, can be defined as the ability to do more than present. It is very well in hand in hand to Kaizen or Continuous Improvement.

We want to improve day by day and want our software to reflect the same. It can be taking up more load, or doing more tasks as compared to today.

Some principles for getting more things done are as follows

1. Decrease processing time
  * Co-location (keeping data and code closer)
  * Caching
  * Pooling
  * Parallelization
  * Partitioning
  * Remoting 
2. Scalability is about concurrency
3. Test continuously
4. Architect up front
