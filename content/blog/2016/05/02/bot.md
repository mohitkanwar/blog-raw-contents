Bot
===
An Internet bot, also known as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. 

Such programs are usually visible in chatting apps, where bots are chatting with actual users to advertise the products that they are selling.


Bots are just a tool to automate some features. The advantage they have is that they can mimic the behaviour of an actual user and it is very difficult to differentiate between the two. The advantage that bots have over humans is that they are much much faster than humans. 

As said, it is a tool and it can be used for constructive as well as destructive purposes.

Constructive Purposes of Bots
------------------------------

 * Building a customer service for basic questions and answers (e.g. Chatterbots)
 * Extracting data from various websites e.g. [Profile Hopper](https://www.profilehopper.com/)

Destructive Purposes of Bots
----------------------------
 * Advertising where it is not appropriate (or allowed, e.g. chatting apps)
 * Site Scrapping for personal data (or other prohibited information)

 It depends upon how to use it. My view on bots is that they are really helpful servents. Since a single person can not do what all s/he wants her/himself in a given time. We can utilize these servents to do some activities on our behalf and get things done. We can simply use the output that they are providing. Again, there is a very thin line between what is ethical and what is not, I would recommend you to consult the data owners before copying any data.  
 Crossing the line of ethics may lead to big troubles. (Even if not, why to cross it?)

 I would be sharing some examples on bots soon.
