Design Patterns
===============
<p>Design patterns are identified solutions to a particular problem. These can be referenced in case of doubts, and can be used exactly or with minor changes as per your problem definition.
This app would help you chose an identified solution (aka design pattern) for the type of problem that you are facing.</p>
<!--
<h3>Answer following questions </h3>
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to instantiate objects or classes?</li>
<li>Are you trying to create a composition of Classes or Objects?</li>
<li>Are you trying to achieve communication between two objects?</li>
</ul>
Creational Design Patterns
--------------------------
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to create an instance from one of several families of classes? : Abstract Factory</li>
<li>Are you trying to separate object construction from its representation? :    Builder</li>
<li>Are you trying to create an instance from several derived classes? :    Factory Method</li>
<li>Do you want to avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use ? :    Object Pool</li>
<li>Do you want a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned? :    Prototype</li>
<li>Do you want a class for which only a single instance can exist? :     Singleton</li>
</ul>
 
Structural Design Patterns
--------------------------
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to match interfaces of different classes? :    Adapter</li>
<li>Are you trying to separate an object's interface from its implementation? :    Bridge</li>
<li>Are you trying to create a tree structure of simple and composite objects? : Composite</li>
<li>Are you trying to add responsibilities to objects dynamically? : Decorator</li>
<li>Do you want a single class that represents an entire subsystem? : Facade</li>
<li>Do you need a fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing? : Flyweight</li>
<li>Do you want to restrict access or modify access? :  Private Class Data</li>
<li>Do you want an object which represents another object? : Proxy</li>
</ul>
 
Behavioral design patterns
--------------------------
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to identify a way of passing a request between a chain of objects? :     Chain of responsibility</li>
<li>Are you trying to encapsulate a command request as an object? :    Command</li>
<li>Are you trying to achieve a way to include language elements in a program? :    Interpreter</li>
<li>Are you trying to sequentially access the elements of a collection? :    Iterator</li>
<li>Are you trying to defines simplified communication between classes? :    Mediator</li>
<li>Are you trying to capture and restore an object's internal state? :    Memento</li>
<li>Are you trying to design an object to act as a default value of an object? :    Null Object</li>
<li>Are you trying to identify a way of notifying change to a number of classes? :    Observer</li>
<li>Are you trying to alter an object's behaviour when its state changes? :    State</li>
<li>Are you trying to encapsulate an algorithm inside a class? :    Strategy</li>
<li>Are you trying to defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass? :    Template method</li>
<li>Are you trying to define a new operation to a class without change? :    Visitor</li>
</ul>
