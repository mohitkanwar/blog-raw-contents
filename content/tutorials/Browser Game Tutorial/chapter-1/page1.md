Introduction
============

Browser Games are the games which can be played in all browsers. They are generally written in pure web technologies i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the technologies involved. If you are already aware of these technologies, you can skip this chapter.

HTML
----
Hyper Text Markup Language is a language which is used to present data in a user viewable format. HTML helps us to categorize and define layouts in such a way that the view is presentable. It makes information more readable as compared to plain text.

HTML is written in XML format, i.e. it has some open and closed tags. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and is supported by all the major browsers. HTML is the standard which all browsers understand and parse for displaying the information for websites.

CSS
---
CSS (a.k.a Cascaded Style Sheets) enhance HTML by segregating the styling from layout. Using CSS we can define text colour, height/width or position of any HTML element.

JavaScript
----------

JavaScript is a scripting language which runs on all major browsers and can interact with HTML. Generally it is used to give dynamic effect to a static HTML page. JavaScript helps creating new elements/ removing old ones, making AJAX calls and many more.
